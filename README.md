# VideoShare-FrontEnd (name pending)
Front End for my web based video sharing platform.

## Description
React based Front End for video platform utilizing own Back End (link later). The goal was to have a website where users can **tag and name videos** obtained from a database, find videos they are interested in and download them. In addition, filtering and ordering of the videos for ease of use were considered. Back End side processes information about the videos and generates preview clips as necessary.

```Image of site comes here, when ready```

## Used technologies and techniques

* Javascript (React & React-Router(?))
* Tailwind based Styling
* Single person Scrum concept - Mainly just the introspection and Sprint logic

## Installation and running 

(For testing locally):

- Clone the project
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` 

Back End should also be running - I will see that the Back End has some test videos when that part is done.
